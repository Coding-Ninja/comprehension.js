comprehension.js
===

Python has lovely list comprehension, out of boredom I made a very horrid version of something like comprehension for JavaScript, its totally useless other then for trivial cases.

## Usage

First clone down the repo:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/coding-ninja/comprehension.js
$ cd comprehension.js/
```

Next up we just need to install all the JavaScript dependencies:

```shell
$ npm install
```

Now we can run the `mocha` and `chai` tests:

```shell
$ npm run test

Basic Python Like Comprehension Tests
    ✓ should should return the whole array
    ✓ should should return the double each element
    ✓ should should return greater then 1 but also skip out 3


  3 passing (8ms)
```
